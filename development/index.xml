You can choose between various WAF engines and CRS versions. The sandbox parses audit logs and returns our detections in an easy and useful format.
The sandbox is useful for:
integrators and administrators: you can test out our response in case of an urgent security event, such as the Log4j vulnerability; exploit developers/researchers: if you have devised a payload, you can test beforehand if it will be blocked by the CRS and by which versions; CRS developers/rule writers: you can quickly check if the CRS catches a (variant of an) exploit without the hassle of setting up your own CRS instance.</description></item></channel></rss>
